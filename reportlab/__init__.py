"""Lightweight stand-in for the real :mod:`reportlab` package.

This module provides a very small subset of the real project's
functionality so the test suite can run in environments where the
dependency is not installed.  When a full installation of ReportLab is
available on ``sys.path`` *outside* of this repository we prefer to use
that implementation instead of the stub.  This mirrors the behaviour of
optional dependencies: local development gets the complete feature set
while the test environment continues to rely on the tiny fallback
defined in this repo.
