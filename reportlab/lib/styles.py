"""Minimal styling utilities for report generation tests.

This module provides a very small subset of the real ReportLab styling API
that is sufficient for the unit tests in this repository.  The previous
implementation returned an empty dictionary which resulted in ``KeyError``
exceptions whenever a style such as ``"Title"`` or ``"Heading1"`` was
requested.  The real ReportLab library ships with a sample style sheet that
contains a number of basic styles; here we emulate only the pieces that are
required by :mod:`AutoML` when building PDF reports.

The goal of this module is not to be feature complete, but rather to provide
just enough behaviour so that code relying on ``getSampleStyleSheet`` can run
without raising exceptions.
