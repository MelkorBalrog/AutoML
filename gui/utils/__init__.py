"""Utility helpers exposed for backward-compatible imports.

This package re-exports commonly used utilities so that modules can simply
``import gui.utils`` and access members such as :mod:`logger` or
``DIALOG_BG_COLOR``.  Keeping these aliases here preserves compatibility with
older code that expected these objects to live directly under
``gui.utils``.
"""

# The logging helper is implemented in ``logger.py`` but we import it here so
# ``from gui.utils import logger`` continues to work.
from . import logger  # noqa: F401

# Treeview convenience helpers live in the top level ``gui`` package. Importing
# them here preserves backward compatibility for modules that relied on
# ``from gui.utils import add_treeview_scrollbars``.
# ``add_treeview_scrollbars`` is defined in the top-level ``gui`` package. To
# avoid circular import issues during package initialisation we lazily resolve
# the real implementation on first use and forward the call.
