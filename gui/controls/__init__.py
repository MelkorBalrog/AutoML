The messagebox module is imported lazily to avoid circular import issues.  It
depends on high level widgets defined in :mod:`gui.__init__`, so importing it
at module import time would cause a partially initialised package when
``gui`` itself loads controls.  ``__getattr__`` performs a deferred import when
``messagebox`` is first requested.
