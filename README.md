This repository contains a graphical fault tree analysis tool. The latest update adds a **Review Toolbox** supporting peer and joint review workflows.

## Review Toolbox

Launch the review features from the **Review** menu:

* **Start Peer Review** – every participant can add comments to any node.
* **Start Joint Review** – define reviewers and approvers. Approvers may only approve once all reviewers have marked their work complete and all comments are resolved.
* **Open Review Toolbox** – opens a window to add and resolve comments. Selecting a comment focuses the related node.
* **Set Current User** – choose which participant you are when entering comments.

Review information (participants, comments, approval state) is saved as part of the model file and restored on load.
