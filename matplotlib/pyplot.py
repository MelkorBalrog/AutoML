    the execution environment for the tests, so we provide a lightâ€‘weight
    shim that implements just the bits we need.  Currently the code exercises
    the ``annotate``, ``scatter`` and ``text`` methods on an axes instance.

    Each method simply accepts any arguments and performs no action.  This is
    sufficient for our non-graphical testing purposes while preserving the
    expected API surface.
